## Customer Churn Analysis

### Problem

Define KPIs.
Create a dashboard on customer retention data.
Give feedback on findings and make recommendations.


### Solution

1. Overall churn rate is 26.5%
2. Customers with month-month contracts have a higher churn rate. Recommended incentivizing them to take on long-term (1 or 2-year) contracts thereby increasing the sale of long-term contracts by 5 to 10%. This should increase the retention of these customers.
3. Observed that additional tech support might be necessary to reduce the number of tech tickets, as customers that open above 1 tech ticket have a higher churn rate.
4. Fiber Optic service subscribers tend to churn, hence we recommended looking into the quality of service provided to customers on this plan.
