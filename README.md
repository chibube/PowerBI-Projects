## Customer Churn Analysis

### Problem

Define KPIs.
Create a dashboard on customer retention data.
Give feedback on findings and make recommendations.


### Solution

1. Overall churn rate is 26.5%
2. Customers with month-month contracts have a higher churn rate. Recommended incentivizing them to take on long-term (1 or 2-year) contracts thereby increasing the sale of long-term contracts by 5 to 10%. This should increase the retention of these customers.
3. Observed that additional tech support might be necessary to reduce the number of tech tickets, as customers that open above 1 tech ticket have a higher churn rate.
4. Fiber Optic service subscribers tend to churn, hence we recommended looking into the quality of service provided to customers on this plan.

## Hospitality Analysis

### Problem

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

Task:  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

### Solutions & Insights

1. There is a negative correlation between revenue and revenue per guest, this is probably because the more expensive rooms have fewer guests/bookings. 
2. The Atliq palace and Atliq City have a relatively high average revenue per guest and revenue realized.
3. The revenue generated on Mondays decreased relative to other days from May to July.
4. Bookings with an average revenue per guest of 5000 or less account for 40% of total bookings, 78% of cancelled bookings, 27% of total realized revenue, and 71% of total lost revenue. 
5. Properties that cost up to 13,000 per guest had 0 cancelled bookings.
6. Increase the average ratings of Atliq seasons and Atliq Grands to 4, this could be done by improving on the services to customers.
